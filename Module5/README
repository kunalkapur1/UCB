Summary of findings

Hypothesis for Bar Coupons
1. Frequent (4+/month) bar goers acceptance rate was highest at 0.77, however, they represented only a small population of 7.5% (153 participants) of the 2017 bar coupon accepting population. By comparison a larger population 33% (666 participants) were accepted by < 4/month bar goers. It may be that in general, there are far fewer people who frequent bars 4+/month.
2. Acceptance was higher when kids were not passengers.

Independent Investigation
Analyzing the "Coffee House" coupon data, key hypothesis:
1. Iterating through multiple columns, destination "No Urgent Place" had high acceptance.
2. Heatmap analysis shows that most coffee house coupons were accepted before 2pm, and for destinations other than Home.
3. Heatmap analysis shows that most coffee house coupons were accepted by people who visited coffee houses 1-8 times a month and ordered Carry Out < 8 times a month.
