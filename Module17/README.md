## Summary of Findings
1. From Test Accuracy perspective, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), were the top 2 models, followed closely by Decision Tree (DT) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
2. DT offer easy human interpretability, and the fastest training times. 
3. SVM is the slowest by far, and made experimenting with multiple parameters difficult.

### Layman summary
Based on the tuned models test accuracy, SVM scored the highest at 0.8975, so it offers the best results.
However, if human interpretability is important, Decision Tree offers comparable test accuracy at 0.8962.
