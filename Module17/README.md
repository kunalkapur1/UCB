Summary of Findings:
1. From Test Accuracy perspective, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) were the top 2 models, followed closely by K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and lastly Decision Tree (DT).
2. LR and DT offer easy interpretability, and the fastest training times, hence recommended. Although they differ in their top features:
* LR Top Features: Employment Variation Rate, Month of last contact (March), Consumer Price Index
* DT Top Features: Age, Number of employees, Euribor 3 month rate
3. SVM is comparitively the slowest by far, and made experimenting with multiple parameters impractical.
