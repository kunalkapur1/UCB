# Summary of Findings

## Recommendations to our valued Dealers:
**1. Year (0.427802):** This has the strongest positive impact, indicating that newer cars (higher 'year' value) command significantly higher prices. This aligns with common understanding as newer cars typically have lower mileage, better technology, and less wear and tear. <br>
**2. Odometer (-0.308912):** This has the strongest negative impact, meaning higher mileage (odometer reading) leads to considerably lower car prices. This is a fundamental depreciation factor for used cars. <br>
**3. Type_Truck (0.219557) & Type_Pickup (0.123724):** These vehicle types show a substantial positive influence on price. Trucks and pickups tend to be more expensive due to their utility, durability, and often higher original purchase price. <br>
**4. Cylinders (0.188067):** A higher number of cylinders is associated with a higher price, likely due to larger engines often found in more powerful trucks or luxurious vehicles. <br>
**5. Drive_FWD (-0.162803):** Front-wheel drive (FWD) cars are associated with a negative impact on price, suggesting that other drive types (like 4WD or RWD) might be preferred or found in higher-priced vehicles. <br>
**6. Condition:** Better conditions (like 'excellent' and 'like new') generally correlate with higher prices, while 'unknown' condition also shows a positive coefficient, which could be an artifact of how missing values were handled or suggest that cars with unspecified conditions can still fetch good prices depending on other attributes. <br>
**7. Manufacturer:** (e.g., Ferrari, BMW): Certain manufacturers, like Ferrari, tend to have a positive impact on price, as expected for luxury or high-performance brands.
